Short observations on memory copies
===================================

 - Copy times appear to be consistently linear, ~13.1 MB/s to the device.
 - Competitors copying 10MB chunks appears to have very little overall impact on response times.
   - Good news? This may imply that memory copies may be blocked only be other ongoing copies?
   - Next test: competitors should copy the full 100MB chunks
