Rodinia-based Plugins
=====================

This directory contains some plugins based on modified forms of a handful of
Rodinia 3.1 benchmarks. The plugins here were modified to satisfy the plugin
shared-library interface.

Usage
-----

Run `make rodinia_plugins` from the top-level plugin framework directory. This
will build the plugins and put them in `bin/` directory with the other plugins.
